COVID-19 has emerged as global pandemic affecting almost the entire globe. This has tested public health preparedness to the optimum level even in developed countries who are still struggling to deal with the situation. In India as on 08-04-2020 there were 5171 active cases of COVID-19. The COVID-19 has created fear and made us realize how bad this can turn out to be for the poorest, for those who will lose their livelihood, or those who wouldn't know what to do to save themselves when the virus has reached someone close to them. It has also put additional strain on the already challenged healthcare system.
