Due to the lack of proper sanitation facilities in Tiruninravur block, Tiruvallur district, the locals were suffering, especially young children and adolescent girls. With the help of Wipro, DFY was able to help construct toilets in the area in the initial phase to improve sanitation facilities. There are plans to expand the programme after evaluation and further assessment.

A vast majority of people, infants, children, men, women and old people have benefitted and continue to benefit from the camps conducted and being conducted by DFY in Chennai, Cuddalore and Tiruvallur. First aid kits have also been distributed to schools where camps were conducted. A number of schools have shown their appreciation by providing letters to the DFY team.
