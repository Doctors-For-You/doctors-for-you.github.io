Punjab as compared to other states is a very high volume farming state. An average Punjabi farmer manages farmlands highly efficiently through automations thus he also produces higher yields in shorter intervals. This causes a very short time between one crop to another that leads them chose burning. But traditionally they used to adopt a very unique technique which used to convert crop residue to fertilizers. The process is very slow and did not suit the farmers, thus they started adopting burning rather than traditional methods.

Doctors For You (DFY) with support of CII foundation (CIIF) has launched a unique program to control Stubble burning in Punjab. The project was launched in Dodra Multi Purpose Agriculture Cooperative Society, Punjab. Under the society there is total of 3 villages. The burning has caused a series of health concern from suffocation not just Punjab but also neighboring states like Delhi and other northern states. The initiative is promoting the indigenous knowledge of crop residue management with modern techniques leading to highly cost effective and multi-layer beneficial program for a farmer. The program has been welcomed by all farmers in the 3 villages where there are over 500+ farmers who are agreed to participate in the Zero biomass burning zone creation.
