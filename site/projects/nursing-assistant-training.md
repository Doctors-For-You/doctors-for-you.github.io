In slum areas the health care services are provided by private clinics of general practitioners (GPs). These GPs hire girls and women from neighbourhood as assistant, at a very modest salary as these women and girls are untrained. At the same time, DFY also faced difficulty in hiring qualified staff for community out reach as well as health promotional activity. Sensing this gap as potential opportunity DFY started 6 months health assistant training course for adolescent girls and women from the community. The course was tailor made for candidates with minimum qualification of 8th standard. The course material was also converted in Hindi.
