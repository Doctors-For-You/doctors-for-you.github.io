First 1000 Days from conception (upto 2 years of age) is the most crucial phase of child life where maximum development of the Brain and all other vital organs occur. If the Pregnant mother and child is deprived of proper nutrition during this time damage to the brain and body will be irreversible. It can be easily visualized in the given image.
SAM (Severe Acute Malnutrition) and MAM (Mild Acute Malnutrition) are the terms widely used now or categorizing the malnourished children. Children with SAM have severe chances of getting infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality than normal children.

#### URBAN INTERVENTION

Situation in the Project Area i.e. M East Ward of MCGM ( various slum areas and Resettlement colonies): Malnutrition among children below 5 years of age is a major health problem in M East ward of Mumbai. The malnutrition prevalence ranges upto 60% 16% to 59.8 % in this area. The Govt sources confirm that at least, a quarter of children below six years in the city weighed at anganwadis are underweight, according to the latest monthly progress report (MPR) of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) [1] . In Sathe Nagar of Mankhurd, the Under nutrition percent is 41.67 [2] while in Rafique Nagar of Govandi 59.8% are undernourished (SAM- 22.2% and MAM- 37.6%) [3] . The data collected at the Doctors For You health centre in Mankhurd suggests that 35.16% children below 5 years of age are malnourished (15.1% Severe Underweight and 20.1% Moderate Underweight). Researchers working in the field have suggested that IMR in certain pockets of the ward could in fact be way above 100/ 1000 live births [4] . Diarrhoea and pneumonia account for approximately half the under five deaths in India, and malnutrition is believed to contribute to 61% of Diarrheal deaths and 53% of pneumonia deaths.

*We are guilty of many errors and faults,but our worst crime is abandoning the children. Many of the things we need can wait. The child cannot.Right now is the time his bones are being formed, his blood is being made and his senses are being developed. To him we cannot answer ‘tomorrow’. His name is Today’..*
