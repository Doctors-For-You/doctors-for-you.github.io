      Dr. Chandrakant Umakant Patil was one of the team members
      of DFY's first humanitarian response team deployed in Bihar
      responding to flood disaster in 2008-09.
      While our team was organizing health camp, a lightning struck
      us on 21st september 2008.
      Unfortunately, Dr. Chandrakant happened to be on its path
      and succumbed to his injuries.

    <div class="small text-justify mb-3">
      Chandrakant was a small town boy with extra-ordinary determination and dedication, who was inspired by the idea that every small contribution counts. Through his immeasurable and ultimate sacrifice, he left an indelible impression on the people who knew him. Born in a small village called Saturkhe in the Nandurbar district of Maharashtra, he had humble origins. His father worked in a textile mill and mother was a housewife. The family had to move to several different villages and towns of state due to transferable nature of his father's job. His childhood is speckled with illustrations of determination to learn and excel in the face of all odds. For instance, most of his schools were located at distances of several kilometers away and the path to them was covered with jungles and sewers. Young Chandrakant was not daunted by these obstacles and continued his education despite the circumstance. Unfortunately, at one point (Sakharkheda village, Buldhana district), the school was so far from the family's dwelling that he was forced to discontinue his schooling for two years. For most other kids of his age this would have marked the end of returning to formal education. But Chandrakant was made of a different mettle. As soon as the family moved to a different town (Pusad taluka in district Yavatmal), he was immediately enrolled in school. So eager was Chandrakant to make up for his lost education and so impressive he was in his scholastic performance in this new school that his teachers asked him to appear for the combined exam of standards II and III! He did so and came out with flying colors. Thus, he managed to partially make up for the years that he loses.

      However, to his dismay, the family move again to a different town (Khurajgaon village in the Saoner taluka of district Nagpur. The place was much bigger and more modern as compared to the other places where the family had stayed. In School, many adjustments had to be made by Chandrakant. Recruiter He realized that he was lagging behind some students in the school who were used to the advanced curriculum. At one point, the disparity and the efficacy became so overwhelming that these teachers requested his parents to consider enrolling him in one of the lower standards to given sufficient time to cope-up with the curriculum. However, the manner in which the family tackled the situation is a case in point. His father wanted him to get another chance. He asked the school authorities to grant him a time of just 7 days to tackle the inadequacies. He promised that if they did not find him up to the mark at the end of day 7 then he would voluntarily enrol him in standard 1. Chandrakant was profoundly influenced by this episode and by the self-belief of his father. Together, they managed to put up a performance that satisfied the school authorities. Chandrakant learnt a great lesson from the episode. His father specifically advised him that he had all the potential and therefore, he should not consider himself lesser than others in the class. After that, there was no looking back for this young man of simple yearnings. Subsequently, he went on to secure distinctions in every subject that he studied in the school. In fact, he switched to English medium school and excelled there as well. He narrowly missed the merit list of standard 10th board exams. However, he more than made up for it by securing rank 15 in the merit list of standard 12th board exams. The icing on the cake was the first rank that he secured in the medical entrance test. He completed his medical school from BJ Medical College, Pune and graduated with first class marks.

    <div class="small text-justify mb-3">
      After completing medical school and a rigorous internship at Dhule, Chandrakant join the post of a medical officer and served the poor at the Kalambhir primary health center. For further training, he secured admission into his dream course in the Department of Preventive & Social Medicine at the Seth GS Medical College & KEM hospital, the twin institutions which are often rated as the Mecca of medical education. During the second year of his course, he came in touch with Ravikant Singh, who was senior to him in the department. When Ravikant decided to take a plunge towards helping the flood- sticken populace of Bihar, Chandrakant was the first doctor who pledged unequivocal support notwithstanding the circumstances that were heavily stacked against them. This is notable since for most other medicos completing the chosen specialty of medicine often takes precedence over almost everything else in the world. On the other hand, here was a man who had swum against the tide to reach his destination and yet did not hesitate to sacrifice it all for the welfare of his brethren. True to his words, Chandrakant took the lead in mobilizing support and manpower for the flood relief operation. In fact, he was part of the first team that set sail for the uncharted territory. In Bihar, Chandrakant went about his task like a possessed man. He extended medical relief to hundreds of patients at a relief camp at Kataiya, Supaul supported by noted filmmaker Mr. Prakash Jha. However, as they say, God takes soonest those he love the best. On the fateful night of September 21, 2008, at around 10.30 PM, Chandrakant was out in the open along with his colleagues after a hard day's work. There he was struck by lightning and suffered severe burns and ultimately succumbed to them.

    <div class="small text-justify mb-3">
      Without doubt, it marked the most poignant day in the history of DFY. It will not be too much to say that it was a water-shed in the history of the organization. The fact that one of the members had become a martyr in the struggle for the cause further galvanized others into working towards the mission with renewed zest and enthusiasm. And rest, as they say, is history. In recognition of his incomparable and selfless sacrifice, we the members of DFY salute him and regard him as our guiding angel. It will be a fitting tribute to Dr. Chandrakant Patil if we can accomplish the work that he had started – if not in the same measure then at least in the same spirit.
