    - Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis was one of the five physicians dispatched to China to provide medical assistance during the second Sino-Japanese war. Widely revered for his exemplary dedication and perseverance, he is continued to be remembered as the champion icon of Sino-Indian friendship and collaboration. Dwarkanath was born to a lower middle class family with two brothers and five sisters, in Solapur district of Maharashtra, and studied medicine at the Seth G. S. Medical College, University of Mumbai. In 1938, a medical team of five doctors was dispatched by the Indian Medical Mission Team to China. Only 28 at that time, he was selected as one of the youngest member of the team. The team sans Dr. Kotnis returned to India safely. He stayed there for 5-yrs working incessantly in mobile clinics to treat wounded soldiers. Taking due cognizance of his self-less service and commitment, he was soon made the director of Dr. Bethune International Peace Hospital. Subsequently, he joined the Mao Zedong's Eighth Route Army at the Jin-Cha-Ji border near the Wutai Mountain Area, armed with nothing but big plans to serve the wounded brave warriors. As a front-line doctor, he often had to work for up to 72-hours at a stretch. During his stint with the army, Dr. Kotnis provided medical aid to thousands of soldiers and conducted more than 800 major operations.
    - However, the hardships of suppressed military life finally started to take its toll on him. As they say, whom the Gods love, die young. On December 9, 1942, at the age of just 32 years, he died of epilepsy. He was buried in the Heroes Courtyard in Nanquan Village with very high honors. At that time, none other than the eminent Mao Zedong mourned his death by observing that "The army has lost a helping hand, the nation has lost a friend. Let us always bear in mind his internationalist spirit." His legacy has been immortalized in the Chinese history. In the Northern Chinese province of Hebei, in Shijiazhuang city, a famous attraction is the Martyr's Memorial park. The north and south sides of the park are dedicated to the veterans of the Korean and the Japanese wars. The west side is dedicated to Norman Bethune, a Canadian who fought for the Chinese, and the east side to Dr Kotnis. There is a great statue in his honor. A small museum there has a handbook of vocabulary that Kotnis wrote on his passage from India to China; some of the instruments that the surgeons used in their medical fight for life, and various photos of the doctors, some with the Communist Party of China's most influential figures, including Mao.
    - The influence of this young man on the contemporary generations can be gauged by the number of masterpieces that have been created in his memory. He has been immortalized in the acclaimed 1946 V. Shantaram movie - Dr Kotnis ki Amar Kahani. China, too, had its own dedication to Dr Kotnis in the form of 1982 movie Dr D.S. Kotnis. There is also a best-selling biographical novel by K.A. Abbas - And One Did Not Come Back (1945). In 1982, China released two postal stamps on the 40th anniversary of the doctor's death. In 1992, on his 50th anniversary, the Chinese Government did an encore. In 1993, the Indian Government followed suit by releasing a stamp showing him conducting a surgery. A towering and respected figure in China, every Chinese Premier who visits India makes it a point to pay the nation's respects to Dr. Kotnis' relatives. They include Zhou En Lai in (1954), Jiang Zemin (1996), Li Peng in 2001 and Zhu Rongji (2002). On his recent visit, the President Hu Jintao met Dr. Kotnis's relatives, including his two surviving sisters, and remembered him as "a bridge between China and India".
    - His life is perhaps best recapitulated in Mackey\'s lines - \"The smallest effort is not lost, each wavelet on the ocean tossed, Aids in the ebb tide or the flow. Each raindrop makes some floweret glow, each struggle lessens human woe.\" Long live the legacies of Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis! We at DFY wish to perpetuate Dr. Kotnis's selfless work and his yeoman service to humanity, if not in the same measure, then at least in the same spirit.

    - Dr. G. Venkataswamy or 'Dr. V' as he is affectionately called is the founder chairman of Aravind Eye Hospital. He was born on October 1, 1918 in Vadamalapuram, a village eighty kilometers from Madurai. He began his university education in the American college, Madurai from which he graduated with a B.A. in chemistry. He received his medical degree from Stanley Medical College at Chennai in 1944. Thereafter, he joined the Indian Army Medical Corps but had to retire in 1948 after developing rheumatoid arthritis. At one point, the arthritis became so severe that he was bedridden for over a year. For a time, he struggled just to walk and could not hold a pen in his badly crippled fingers. Despite his condition, he returned to medical school and earned his diploma and masters degree in Ophthalmology. Through his hard work and determination, Dr. V learned how to hold a scalpel and perform cataract surgery. Eventually, he was able to perform more than one hundred surgeries a day.
    - Dr. V joined the faculty at Madurai Medical College, a government school, where he was appointed head of the Department of Ophthalmology and later served as Vice- Dean of the college. During his period of government service, Dr. V introduced a number of innovative programmes to deal with the problem of blindness in India. He developed the outreach eye camp programmes in 1960, a rehabilitation centre for the blind in 1966, and the creation of an ophthalmic Assistants Training programme in 1973. In his clinical work, Dr. V personally performed over one hundred thousand successful eye surgeries.
    - In recognition of his work in the fight against blindness, Dr, V received the Padmashree award in 1973 by the Government of India. This award is given to citizens, who have rendered outstanding service to their nation. In 1976, after mandatory retirement from government service at age of 58, Dr. V resolved to continue his work in eye care delivery. With support from his family, he founded Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai , a non profit institution dedicated to providing high quality eye care to all patients who come to its door. Dr. V blends his spiritual life to his daily work remarkably well. As a young man, he became a disciple of Sri Aurobindo, an Indian philosopher and saint who lived in service to God and man. Aravind was founded on this principle of service and continues to be guided by it. In 1991, as part of its Wit lectures series, Dr. V was invited to deliver an address at the Harvard Divinity School on the theme of living a spiritual life in the contemporary age. The address entitled 'Illuminated Spirit', has been published and read by many people.
    - Dr. V begins and ends every day at the hospital with a visit to the meditation room for "a silent talk with God". In discussing his work as a spiritual practice, Dr. V has said, "When I go to meditation room at the hospital every morning, I ask God that I be a better tool, a receptacle for the divine force. We can all serve humanity in our normal professional lives by being more generous and less selfish in what we do. You don't have to be a 'religious' person to serve God. You serve God by serving humanity."
    - We at DFY wish to perpetuate the work of Dr. V for the service of the humanity. The selfless work of Dr. V will keep inspiring us in the same spirit.
